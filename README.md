# NameGenerator 🌟

Welcome to my first LLM application, NameGenerator! Utilizing a cutting-edge LLM Model (PaLM) 🤖, this application is designed to creatively generate names that rhyme with a word chosen by the user 📝, and it goes a step further by providing the meanings of those names 📚.

This project was initiated alongside the insightful "LangChain Crash Course For Beginners | LangChain Tutorial" by codebasics, a resource I found immensely helpful 🌈. (Access the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAmC7SoVLd8&ab_channel=codebasics).) The initial version of this application was developed by closely following the tutorial. I started by replicating the code as explained in the course, laying the groundwork for my application 🛠️.

From there, I've embarked on a journey to refine and expand the application beyond its initial scope 🚀. My roadmap includes enhancing the application's core functionality to align more closely with its intended purpose and experimenting with Streamlit design improvements. These steps are not just about learning to code but also about deepening my understanding of Streamlit and LLMs in general 📈.

I'm thrilled to share this learning journey with everyone who's following along 🌍.
Let's dive into this new adventure in the world of LLMs together! 🎉
